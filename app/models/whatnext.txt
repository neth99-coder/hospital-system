* Use DataBaseWrapper class in Registration handler
* It has some methods which can be implemeted in UserHandler (like add / delete users)
* It will be better, if we can remove the user related methods form there and make it the controller of hospitals
* Administrator also contains some user related methods :((
* add_record() in all center classes are not implemented.
* organize VaccinationCenter
* are we going to keep all those classes in the model itself:)))


* What the hell !! I have no idea what you are talking about !!
* Fuck me man !!
* This is so painful
